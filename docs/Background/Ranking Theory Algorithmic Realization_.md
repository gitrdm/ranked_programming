## **Part I: The Philosophical and Formal Foundations of Ranking Theory**

### **Section 1: The Doxastic Problems of Probability and AGM**

The emergence of Wolfgang Spohn's Ranking Theory in the ...bustness and Transfer Learning:** For Ranking Theory to be applicable in real-world systems, it must be robust to noisy, incomplete, or biased data. Research is needed on how to learn robust ranking functions and how to measure and control the sensitivity of inferences to perturbations in the knowledge base. Furthermore, adapting concepts from **transfer learning** to allow ranking structures learned in one domain to be applied to a new, related domain is a critical step toward practical utility.<sup>53</sup>980s was not a development in a vacuum. It was a direct and deliberate response to perceived inadequacies in the two dominant paradigms of formal epistemology at the time: Bayesian probability theory and the Alchourrón-Gärdenfors-Makinson (AGM) theory of belief revision.<sup>1</sup> To fully appreciate the architecture and objectives of Ranking Theory, one must first understand the specific philosophical and formal problems it was designed to solve. It represents not merely a technical refinement of its predecessors but a fundamental reorientation of how to conceptualize and model rational belief and its dynamics. The theory's innovations are best understood as solutions to the distinct, yet related, conundrums posed by probabilistic and qualitative models of belief.

#### **1.1 The Bayesian Conundrum: Degrees of Belief vs. Belief Simpliciter**

Standard Bayesianism, often termed "Pascalian probability," provides a powerful and successful framework for modeling graded belief.<sup>3</sup> In this model, an agent's epistemic state is represented by a probability function, and belief is treated as a quantitative attitude—a "degree of belief" or "credence"—measured on a scale from 0 to 1\.<sup>2</sup> While immensely useful for understanding evidence and confirmation, this framework struggles to account for the common, qualitative notion of "belief simpliciter"—the all-or-nothing state of accepting a proposition as true.<sup>6</sup> Many of the most enduring debates in epistemology and the philosophy of science are framed in terms of this categorical notion of full belief, making Bayesianism, at least prima facie, an ill-suited tool for addressing them directly.<sup>7</sup>

This disconnect manifests most famously in the **Lottery Paradox**. If one attempts to define belief as having a probability above some high threshold (e.g., p\>0.99), a rational agent facing a fair lottery with 1,000 tickets would be forced into an incoherent state. The agent would believe of ticket \#1 that it will lose, of ticket \#2 that it will lose, and so on for all 1,000 tickets. However, the conjunction of these individual beliefs—that all tickets will lose—is a logical contradiction, as one ticket must win. A rational agent should not believe a contradiction. This demonstrates that a simple high-probability threshold for belief fails to satisfy the principle of **deductive closure**, which states that if an agent believes a set of propositions, they should also believe their logical consequences.<sup>6</sup> Spohn's theory was explicitly designed to provide a non-trivial solution to this paradox by preserving a robust, deductively closed notion of full belief.<sup>9</sup>

A second, related issue is the **problem of zero probability**. Within the standard probabilistic framework, if a proposition is assigned a probability of 0, no amount of evidence can ever raise its probability through the normal mechanism of conditionalization. This makes it impossible to model an agent who comes to believe something they previously considered impossible.<sup>2</sup> Spohn sought to avoid this rigidity. His goal was not to equate full disbelief with probability 0, but rather to create a system that could carry nuanced information about the degree to which a belief is "retractable" in the face of new reasons.<sup>9</sup>

#### **1.2 The AGM Impasse: The Problem of Iterated Belief Revision**

While Bayesianism focused on graded belief, the AGM theory, developed by Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and David Makinson, provided a powerful axiomatic framework for the logic of qualitative belief change.<sup>2</sup> It defined rational postulates for three core operations: expansion (adding a new belief), contraction (giving up a belief), and revision (adding a new belief that may contradict old ones).<sup>11</sup> The AGM model's semantics are often given in terms of "entrenchment orderings" or "systems of spheres," which represent how firmly beliefs are held and thus which ones should be given up first to maintain consistency when new information arrives.<sup>2</sup>

Despite its influence, the AGM framework suffered from a critical limitation: its dynamics were incomplete. The theory could elegantly describe a single step of belief revision, but it could not adequately account for *iterated* revision. After an agent revises their beliefs with a new proposition, the AGM postulates specify the new *belief set* (the set of propositions believed to be true). However, they do not specify the agent's new, richer epistemic state—such as the new entrenchment ordering—that is required to guide the *next* belief revision.<sup>2</sup> This failure to preserve the full dynamic structure of the epistemic state was termed a violation of the "principle of categorical matching": the output of the revision process (a belief set) is not the same kind of formal object as the input (an epistemic state capable of guiding revision).<sup>2</sup>

This was the very problem that catalyzed the development of Ranking Theory. Spohn's own account of the theory's origin reveals his dissatisfaction with the existing models. He found Gärdenfors's account of belief change to be "incomplete... too incomplete for the purposes of a theory of causation," a project that requires a robust model of how beliefs evolve over time in response to a sequence of evidence.<sup>1</sup> Ranking Theory was therefore born out of a direct attempt to "fix a problem that besets the AGM theory" by providing a fully dynamic, iterable model of belief change.<sup>2</sup>

The limitations of these prior frameworks highlight a deeper philosophical divergence. Bayesianism is primarily a theory of evidential support, while AGM is a theory of maintaining logical consistency. Spohn's project can be seen as a reorientation of formal epistemology toward a different central concept: the role of **reasons** in driving belief change. His framework is not built around a static "balance of reasons," as in the Laplacian probabilistic view, but a dynamic model akin to a "spring balance," where the "force of the reason A... pulls the... rank of the focal proposition B to its proper place".<sup>9</sup> This shift from static confirmation to dynamic reasoning is the key to understanding the motivation behind the formal apparatus of Ranking Theory.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Formal Epistemic Frameworks**

| Feature | Ranking Theory | Bayesian Probability Theory | AGM Belief Revision Theory |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Object of Representation** | A ranking function assigning graded degrees of disbelief (ranks) to possible worlds.<sup>1</sup> | A probability function assigning graded degrees of belief (credences) to propositions.<sup>5</sup> | A deductively closed set of sentences (a belief set), often supplemented by an entrenchment ordering.<sup>2</sup> |
| **Handles Belief Simpliciter?** | Yes, belief in A is defined as disbelief in \~A (τ(A) \> 0). This provides a deductively closed notion of belief.<sup>6</sup> | No, not directly. Attempts to define belief as high probability face the Lottery Paradox and a failure of deductive closure.<sup>8</sup> | Yes, the belief set is the set of all propositions believed simpliciter, but the model is static.<sup>10</sup> |
| **Primary Update Rule** | Spohn Conditionalization (general case) and Plain Conditionalization (certainty case).<sup>13</sup> | Bayesian Conditionalization (strict or Jeffrey).<sup>2</sup> | AGM postulates for revision, contraction, and expansion.<sup>11</sup> |
| **Handles Iterated Revision?** | Yes, the theory provides a complete, indefinitely iterable dynamics. The output of an update is another ranking function.<sup>2</sup> | No, faces the problem of zero probabilities, making it difficult to recover from absolute disbelief.<sup>2</sup> | No, the theory is incomplete. The AGM postulates do not specify the new epistemic state needed for subsequent revisions.<sup>2</sup> |

### **Section 2: The Formal Architecture of Ranking Functions**

At its core, Ranking Theory is built upon a remarkably simple and elegant formal structure. From a small set of axioms governing a single function, a rich and powerful apparatus emerges for representing a rational agent's complex web of beliefs, disbeliefs, and suspensions of judgment. The entire edifice rests on a foundational insight: that the most primitive doxastic attitude is not belief, but disbelief or surprise. Belief, in this framework, is a derived concept.

#### **2.1 The Foundational Unit: The Negative Ranking Function (κ)**

The fundamental building block of the theory is the **negative ranking function**, denoted by the Greek letter kappa (κ).<sup>3</sup> This function formalizes an agent's grades of disbelief.

* **Definition:** A negative ranking function κ is a function that maps each possible world *w* from a set of all possibilities *W* to a value in the set of non-negative integers plus infinity, N∪∞.8 This function is then extended from individual worlds to propositions (which are simply sets of worlds) by the **minimality rule**: for any non-empty proposition A (a subset of W), the rank of A is the minimum rank of any world contained within it. Formally, κ(A)=minκ(w)∣w∈A.<sup>1</sup>  
* **Interpretation:** The value κ(A) is interpreted as the agent's **disbelief rank** or **grade of disbelief** or **degree of doubt** regarding the proposition A.<sup>1</sup>   
  κ(A)=0 signifies that A is not disbelieved at all; it is considered a "live possibility" by the agent.<sup>14</sup>  
  κ(A)\>0, (a positive rank), indicates that the agent disbelieves A, with a higher numerical rank corresponding to a stronger degree of disbelief or surprise were A to turn out to be true.<sup>6</sup>  
* **Core Axioms:** The behavior of the κ function is governed by a few simple but powerful axioms, the most important of which is the law of disjunction.<sup>3</sup>  
  1. κ(W)=0: The tautological proposition (the set of all possible worlds) is assigned a rank of 0\. A rational agent is never surprised by the tautology; it is not disbelieved.  
  2. κ(∅)=∞: The contradictory proposition (the empty set of worlds) is assigned an infinite rank. A rational agent maximally disbelieves a contradiction.  
  3. κ(A∪B)=minκ(A),κ(B): This is the **law of disjunction** (or the law of negation for negative ranks). It states that the degree of disbelief in a disjunction (A or B) is equal to the degree of disbelief in its most plausible disjunct. This single axiom is the engine of the theory, ensuring that the agent's belief set is both consistent and deductively closed.<sup>6</sup>

#### **2.2 From Disbelief to Belief: The Two-Sided Ranking Function (τ)**

While the negative ranking function κ is the fundamental entity, it is often convenient to work with a derived function that more directly represents degrees of belief. This is the **two-sided ranking function**, denoted by the Greek letter tau (τ).<sup>1</sup>

* **Definition:** The two-sided rank of a proposition A is defined as the difference between the negative rank of its negation and the negative rank of A itself. Formally, τ(A)=κ(∼A)−κ(A).<sup>1</sup> This function can take on positive, negative, or zero integer values.  
* **Interpretation:** The value τ(A) is interpreted as the agent's **degree of belief** in A.<sup>1</sup> The relationship between  
  τ and the qualitative attitudes of belief, disbelief, and suspension is direct and intuitive:  
  * **Belief:** An agent *believes* A if τ(A)\>0. This implies that κ(∼A)\>κ(A). As will be shown by the Law of Negation, this requires κ(∼A)\>0 and κ(A)=0. In other words, an agent believes A precisely when they disbelieve its negation, ∼A.<sup>7</sup>  
  * **Disbelief:** An agent *disbelieves* A if τ(A)\<0. This implies κ(A)\>κ(∼A), meaning the agent disbelieves A more strongly than its negation.  
  * **Suspension of Judgment (Epoché):** An agent *suspends judgment* regarding A if τ(A)=0. This implies κ(A)=κ(∼A). Given the Law of Negation, this can only happen when both are equal to 0\. The agent finds neither A nor its negation surprising.<sup>6</sup> This ability to formally represent a neutral stance is a significant feature of the theory.

#### **2.3 The Law of Negation: Ensuring Coherence**

A crucial and direct consequence of the axiomatic structure of the κ function is what can be called the **Law of Negation**.

* **The Law:** For any proposition A, it must be the case that either κ(A)=0 or κ(∼A)=0 (or both, in the case of suspension).<sup>7</sup> This follows directly from the law of disjunction, since  
  A∪∼A=W (the tautology). Therefore, κ(W)=minκ(A),κ(∼A)=0, which implies that at least one of the two terms in the minimum must be 0\.  
* **Significance:** This law ensures the fundamental coherence of the agent's doxastic state. It is the formal guarantee that an agent cannot simultaneously disbelieve a proposition and its negation. This principle is the bedrock that makes the interpretation of belief as "disbelief in the negation" sound and consistent.

#### **2.4 From Quantitative Ranks to Qualitative Attitudes**

Ranking Theory provides a clear and unambiguous bridge from its quantitative numerical representation to the qualitative doxastic attitudes that are central to traditional epistemology.<sup>1</sup> The two-sided ranking function

τ serves as this bridge.

* **The Rule:** A proposition A is:  
  * **Believed** if and only if τ(A)\>0.  
  * **Disbelieved** if and only if τ(A)\<0.  
  * **Suspended** if and only if τ(A)=0.

Some more general formulations of the theory introduce a "neutrality threshold" z\>0, where belief requires τ(A)≥z and disbelief requires τ(A)≤−z.<sup>1</sup> However, for most purposes, the standard interpretation with a threshold of 0 is sufficient and is the one primarily used in Spohn's work.

This formal architecture reveals a deep philosophical claim. By making the negative ranking function κ the primitive element, Spohn's theory suggests that our most fundamental doxastic relationship to the world is one of *surprise* or *implausibility*. We do not start with a set of things we believe; we start with a graded map of possibilities, where some are considered normal (rank 0\) and others are considered surprising to various degrees (rank \> 0). The things we "believe" are simply a consequence of this underlying structure: they are the propositions whose falsehood would be surprising to us. This inverts the traditional epistemological starting point and provides a powerful, unified explanation for belief, disbelief, and the crucial state of suspended judgment, all from a single, economical formal primitive.

### **Section 3: The Dynamics of Belief Revision**

While the static architecture of ranking functions provides a novel way to represent belief, the theory's most significant contribution lies in its complete and robust account of the *dynamics* of belief change. It was designed specifically to overcome the problem of iterated revision that plagued the AGM framework. The key to this dynamic capacity is the concept of conditional ranks, which allows the theory to represent not just what an agent currently believes, but what they are disposed to believe under various hypothetical circumstances.

#### **3.1 Conditional Ranks: The Key to Dynamics**

The linchpin of the entire dynamic theory is the **conditional rank**. This concept is the rank-theoretic analogue of conditional probability and provides the formal mechanism for belief updating.

* **Definition:** The conditional rank of a proposition B given a proposition A, denoted κ(B∣A), is defined as the rank of their conjunction minus the rank of the condition: κ(B∣A)=κ(A∧B)−κ(A), provided that κ(A)\<∞.<sup>8</sup>  
* **Significance:** This definition is profoundly important. It allows an agent's epistemic state to contain information about what they would believe *if* they were to learn A, even if they currently disbelieve A (i.e., even if κ(A)\>0). This is precisely the rich, forward-looking information that was missing from the static belief sets of AGM theory, which only recorded current beliefs.<sup>1</sup> The structure of conditional ranks effectively encodes the agent's dispositions to change their beliefs in response to future evidence. This definition has a strong parallel to the definition of conditional probability,  
  P(B∣A)=P(A∧B)/P(A). Taking the logarithm transforms this into logP(B∣A)=logP(A∧B)−logP(A), showing that ranks behave like negative log-probabilities, with subtraction in the rank domain corresponding to division in the probability domain.<sup>16</sup>

#### **3.2 Plain Conditionalization: Learning with Certainty**

The simplest case of belief revision occurs when an agent learns a new piece of evidence with absolute certainty. Ranking Theory models this with a rule called **Plain Conditionalization**.

* **The Rule:** If an agent with a prior ranking function κ becomes certain of a proposition E (and no logically stronger proposition), their new posterior ranking function, κ′, is simply their prior conditional ranking function given E. That is, for any proposition A, the new rank is κ′(A)=κ(A∣E).<sup>14</sup>  
* **The Mechanism:** This update rule has a clear and intuitive effect on the plausibility ordering of worlds. It takes all possible worlds where the evidence E is false and assigns them an infinite rank, effectively ruling them out as impossible. Simultaneously, it "rescales" the ranks of the remaining worlds where E is true, shifting them all down by a value of κ(E) so that the most plausible worlds consistent with E now have a rank of 0\.<sup>13</sup>  
* **Analogy and Generalization:** This process is the direct rank-theoretic analogue of **strict conditionalization** in Bayesian probability theory.<sup>2</sup> It can also be seen as a special case of a more general update rule that Spohn calls "  
  A→n-conditionalization," which is the operation of setting the degree of disbelief in the negation of A, κ(∼A), to a new value *n*. Plain conditionalization is the limiting case where n goes to infinity, representing absolute certainty in A (A→∞-conditionalization).<sup>7</sup>

#### **3.3 Spohn Conditionalization: Learning with Uncertainty**

In reality, learning is rarely a matter of acquiring absolute certainties. More often, an experience is uncertain and simply shifts our degrees of belief without making us fully certain of anything. For example, seeing a blurry shape in the distance might increase our belief that it is a ship and decrease our belief that it is a whale, without making us certain of either. To handle this more general and realistic form of learning, Spohn introduced a more powerful update rule.

* **The Rule:** **Spohn Conditionalization** is the rank-theoretic analogue of Jeffrey Conditionalization from probability theory.<sup>2</sup> It applies when an experience induces a direct change in the ranks of the elements of a partition of possibilities  
  E1​,E2​,...,Ek​. Suppose the agent's experience changes the ranks of these partition elements to new values n1​,n2​,...,nk​. The new rank of any specific world *w* that falls within a particular partition element Ei​ is updated according to the formula: κ′(w)=κ(w)−κ(Ei​)+ni​.13  
* **The Mechanism:** This rule preserves the *relative* plausibility of worlds *within* each partition element, while shifting the entire element up or down in plausibility according to the new information. It is a far more flexible and nuanced model of learning than Plain Conditionalization, as it does not require the evidence to be a single, certain proposition.  
* **The Full Dynamic Framework:** The general rule of A→n-conditionalization provides a unified framework for all types of belief change. When n=∞, it is Plain Conditionalization (revision by a certainty). When n is a finite positive number, it is a revision that makes A believed to a specific degree. And when n=0, it is **contraction**—the operation of ceasing to believe A by reducing the disbelief in its negation to zero.<sup>7</sup> This shows the remarkable unifying power of the framework.

#### **3.4 Solving the Iteration Problem**

The dynamic rules of Ranking Theory provide a definitive solution to the problem of iterated belief revision that stymied the AGM framework. The key is the principle of **categorical matching**.

* **The Solution:** When a ranking function is updated via Plain or Spohn Conditionalization, the result of the update is another, well-formed ranking function.<sup>2</sup> The entire rich structure of the agent's epistemic state—including all the conditional ranks that encode dispositions for future belief change—is preserved and updated. The output of the process is the same kind of formal object as the input. This allows the process to be repeated indefinitely, providing a complete dynamic account of how a rational agent's beliefs should evolve through any sequence of learning experiences.<sup>12</sup> This is arguably the theory's single greatest formal advantage over its predecessors.

The dynamic laws of Ranking Theory are more than just formal update rules; they provide a precise, quantitative explication of what it means for one proposition to be a **reason** for another. The common-sense intuition is that A is a reason for B if coming to believe A would make you believe B more firmly.<sup>7</sup> Ranking Theory captures this formally: A is a reason for B if and only if the two-sided rank of B given A is greater than the two-sided rank of B given the negation of A, i.e.,

τ(B∣A)\>τ(B∣∼A).<sup>7</sup> This definition allows for a rich taxonomy of reasons (e.g., sufficient, necessary) and connects the purely mathematical dynamics of the theory back to the core philosophical project of understanding justification and rational inference. This is a central part of Spohn's ambition to create a "widely applicable theory of Baconian probability"—a logic of belief and reasons, not just of evidence and chance.<sup>3</sup>

## **Part II: The Algorithmic Realization of Ranking Theory**

While Ranking Theory's philosophical foundations and formal elegance are compelling, its practical value, particularly for fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI), hinges on its **algorithmic realization**. Below are details on how the rich semantic structure of ranking functions can be leveraged to create concrete algorithms for knowledge representation and reasoning. The central challenge is one of complexity: a naive implementation is computationally intractable. The research in this area, therefore, is a story of developing clever, structured approaches that make the theory's power accessible to machines.

### **Section 4: A Semantic Foundation for Non-Monotonic Reasoning**

One of the most significant applications of Ranking Theory in AI is as a semantic foundation for **non-monotonic reasoning (NMR)**. NMR is the study of defeasible, common-sense inference, where conclusions are drawn tentatively and may be retracted in light of new information. This stands in stark contrast to classical logic, which is monotonic: adding new premises can only expand, never shrink, the set of conclusions.<sup>18</sup>

#### **4.1 The "Birds Fly" Problem in AI**

The quintessential example of NMR is the "Tweety" problem. From the premise "Tweety is a bird," we defeasibly conclude "Tweety flies." However, if we subsequently learn "Tweety is a penguin," we retract the initial conclusion and infer "Tweety does not fly".<sup>18</sup> Formalizing this type of plausible but retractable reasoning was a major challenge for early AI. It led to the development of a wide variety of formalisms, including default logic, circumscription, and autoepistemic logic.<sup>4</sup> Many of these were syntactic, rule-based systems.

Ranking Theory offers a different, more unified approach. It provides a quantitative, model-based semantics that explains *why* such reasoning is rational.<sup>22</sup> Instead of just providing a set of inference rules, it models the underlying epistemic state of an agent for whom these inferences are valid. It thus provides a solid "foundation for accounts of defeasible or nonmonotonic reasoning".<sup>6</sup>

#### **4.2 Modeling Defaults and Exceptions with Ranks**

The core of the rank-theoretic solution lies in its ability to model default rules and their exceptions through a graded plausibility ordering.

* **The Conditional as a Default:** A default rule, such as "Birds typically fly," is represented as a conditional, (Fly|Bird). An agent's epistemic state, represented by a ranking function κ, is said to accept this default if the worlds that verify the rule are strictly more plausible (have a lower rank) than the worlds that falsify it. Formally, κ accepts (Fly|Bird) if and only if κ(Bird∧Fly)\<κ(Bird∧∼Fly).<sup>23</sup>
* **Handling Exceptions with a Layered Plausibility Space:** The power of the framework becomes apparent when dealing with exceptions. A more specific rule, like "Penguins typically do not fly," represented as (∼Fly|Penguin), can coexist with the general rule. A ranking function can accommodate both by structuring the space of possible worlds into layers of plausibility. For instance, a rational agent's ranking function might look like this:  
  * **Rank 0 (Most Plausible):** Worlds where Tweety is not a bird.  
  * **Rank 1:** Worlds where Tweety is a flying, non-penguin bird.  
  * **Rank 2:** Worlds where Tweety is a non-flying penguin.  
  * **Rank 3 (or higher):** Worlds where Tweety is a flying penguin (a strong exception to a specific rule) or a non-flying, non-penguin bird (an exception to the general rule).

In this state, upon learning "Tweety is a bird," the agent's focus shifts to the most plausible bird-worlds (Rank 1), leading to the conclusion "Tweety flies." However, upon learning the more specific information "Tweety is a penguin," the focus shifts to the most plausible penguin-worlds (Rank 2), leading to the conclusion "Tweety does not fly." The graded structure of disbelief naturally handles the specificity of evidence and the defeat of default conclusions.<sup>6</sup>

#### **4.3 Connecting to Formal Properties of NMR**

Ranking Theory's approach is not ad-hoc; it connects directly to the abstract properties of rational non-monotonic inference studied in the literature.

* **Preferential Model Semantics:** The idea of ordering possible worlds by "normality" or "plausibility" and defining inference relative to the most normal models is a general semantic strategy for NMR known as **preferential models**, pioneered by Yoav Shoham and further developed by Sarit Kraus, Daniel Lehmann, and Menachem Magidor (KLM).<sup>20</sup> A ranking function is a specific, numerically-grounded instance of such a preferential model, where the ranks define the preference ordering.<sup>23</sup>  
* **Validating Rationality Postulates:** Because of its well-defined axiomatic structure, the inference relation generated by a ranking function automatically satisfies key postulates for rational reasoning. For example, it validates **Rational Monotony**, a central property in the KLM framework. This postulate states that if you can defeasibly infer ψ from a set of premises Σ, and another proposition φ is not considered impossible (i.e., you do not disbelieve it), then you should still be able to infer ψ after adding φ to your premises.<sup>20</sup> The fact that Ranking Theory's semantics gives rise to such desirable inferential behavior provides a powerful theoretical justification for its use as a normative model of NMR.

This connection reveals how Ranking Theory bridges a historical divide in AI research between syntactic, rule-based systems and semantic, model-based systems. It provides a concrete, quantitative semantic model (the ranking function) that generates a well-behaved, rule-like inference relation. This offers a deeper and more unified foundation for NMR than many of the disparate systems that preceded it, explaining why it has proven "most useful in Artificial Intelligence".<sup>22</sup>

### **Section 5: Computational Implementations for Knowledge Representation**

Translating the elegant semantics of Ranking Theory into a working computational system presents a significant hurdle: the **curse of dimensionality**. The domain of a ranking function is the set of all possible worlds, a set whose size (2N) grows exponentially with the number of propositional variables (*N*) in the language. Directly representing and reasoning over this space is computationally infeasible for all but the most trivial problems.<sup>28</sup> The algorithmic realization of Ranking Theory, therefore, has focused on developing tractable methods that capture the essence of the theory without incurring exponential costs. This research, led in large part by Gabriele Kern-Isberner and her collaborators, has centered on a special, constructively defined subclass of ranking functions.

#### **5.1 c-Representations: A Tractable Subclass of Ranking Functions**

To overcome the complexity challenge, Kern-Isberner introduced a highly structured and computationally amenable subclass of ranking functions known as **c-representations** (for "conditional" or "constructive" representations).

* **Definition:** A c-representation is not defined over the entire space of worlds directly. Instead, it is constructed compositionally from a knowledge base R consisting of a set of conditional statements or default rules. Each conditional δ in the knowledge base is assigned a non-negative integer "impact" or "penalty," denoted η(δ). The rank of any given possible world ω is then defined as the sum of the impacts of all the conditionals in R that are falsified by that world.<sup>29</sup> Formally:

  κη​(ω)=∑δ∈R,ω falsifies δ​η(δ)  
* **Significance:** This definition is a major conceptual and computational breakthrough. It transforms the problem from assigning ranks to an exponential number of worlds to the much more manageable task of assigning integer impacts to a (typically much smaller) set of rules. It provides a direct, constructive method for building a ranking function from a human-understandable knowledge base of defaults.<sup>28</sup>

#### **5.2 c-Inference via Constraint Solving**

For a c-representation to be a valid model of the knowledge base R, it must itself satisfy the acceptance condition for every conditional within R. This fundamental requirement is the key to its algorithmic implementation.

* **The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):** The condition that a c-representation κη​ must accept each conditional δi​∈R translates into a set of numerical inequalities involving the integer impacts η(δj​). For each conditional, the inequality states that its impact must be greater than a certain value determined by the impacts of other conditionals. The collection of all such inequalities for all conditionals in R forms a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** over the integer variables η(δj​).27 Finding a valid set of impacts is equivalent to finding a solution to this CSP.  
* **Skeptical c-Inference:** In non-monotonic reasoning, it is often desirable to draw conclusions that are robust and not dependent on an arbitrary choice of model. **Skeptical inference** achieves this by defining a conclusion as valid if and only if it holds in *all* valid models. In this context, a conditional (B∣A) is a skeptical c-consequence of a knowledge base R if it is accepted by *every* valid c-representation of R. This inferential task can also be modeled as a CSP. To check if (B∣A) is a skeptical consequence, one constructs a CSP that includes the constraints for R *plus* an additional constraint asserting that (B∣A) is *not* accepted. If this combined CSP is unsatisfiable (has no solution), it proves that (B∣A) must be a consequence of R in all valid c-representations.27  
* **Implementation with SMT Solvers:** This formulation of inference as a constraint problem opens the door to powerful, general-purpose algorithmic tools. The CSP for c-inference can be systematically transformed into an equivalent **Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)** problem, specifically using the theory of integer linear arithmetic.<sup>28</sup> This allows researchers to leverage highly optimized, off-the-shelf SMT solvers, such as Microsoft's Z3, to perform c-inference. This step was crucial in moving c-inference from a theoretical curiosity to a practically implementable reasoning system. This SMT-based approach has dramatically increased the scalability of the method, enabling inference from belief bases with up to 100 atomic propositions—a domain involving  
  2100 possible worlds, far beyond the reach of any previous implementation.<sup>28</sup>

#### **5.3 Localizing Computation: Constraint Networks and Splitting**

Even with powerful solvers, the complexity of the CSP can be a bottleneck. A key strategy for further enhancing scalability is to exploit the structure of the knowledge base to "divide and conquer" the reasoning task.

* **Syntax Splitting:** The simplest case of this is **syntax splitting**. If a knowledge base ∆ can be partitioned into two sub-bases, ∆1​ and ∆2​, that share no atomic propositions (i.e., are defined over disjoint vocabularies), then reasoning can be performed on each part independently, and the results combined. This property ensures that reasoning is "local" and does not produce spurious inferences between unrelated topics.<sup>30</sup>  
* **Constraint Networks:** For the more common and complex case where sub-bases overlap, Kern-Isberner et al. developed the framework of **constraint networks**. This approach is based on identifying a "safe cover" of the knowledge base—a collection of potentially overlapping sub-bases. The dependencies between these sub-bases are represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The algorithm then proceeds iteratively through this graph: it solves the CSP for the simplest, most fundamental sub-bases first, and then propagates the computed penalty points as fixed numerical values into the constraints of the more complex sub-bases that depend on them. This method localizes the computationally expensive constraint solving to smaller subproblems while ensuring that the final, globally assembled c-representation is consistent.<sup>30</sup>

#### **5.4 Integration with Answer Set Programming (ASP)**

Another avenue of algorithmic realization involves integrating Ranking Theory's semantic insights with other established Knowledge Representation (KR) formalisms, such as **Answer Set Programming (ASP)**. ASP is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming that is well-suited for solving complex combinatorial search problems.<sup>23</sup>

* **Ranking to Prioritize Solutions:** One hybrid approach uses a ranking-theoretic semantics, such as System Z (an important precursor to c-representations), to compute a plausibility ranking over all possible worlds. This ranking is then used as an external preference criterion to select the "most preferred" answer sets from those generated by an ASP program. This effectively uses the conditional knowledge base to guide the reasoning of the ASP solver, resolving ambiguities or making choices in a principled, semantically-grounded way.<sup>23</sup> This integration can be performed post-hoc (generating all answer sets and then ranking them) or, more efficiently, by compiling the ranking constraints directly into the ASP program itself to prune the search space.<sup>23</sup>

The journey from Spohn's abstract theory to these computational systems illustrates a classic theme in AI: the trade-off between expressive power and computational tractability. Spohn's original theory is maximally expressive but infeasible to implement directly. Kern-Isberner's c-representations introduce a structural constraint (ranks as sums of penalties) that sacrifices some generality for a compositional structure. The move to SMT solvers leverages decades of research in automated reasoning to handle this structure efficiently. Finally, techniques like constraint networks further refine the process by exploiting the specific modularity of a given knowledge base. This entire trajectory is a story of principled approximation and decomposition, showing how a "pure" philosophical theory is progressively shaped and reframed to become a viable engineering tool.

### **Section 6: Algorithms for Dynamic Belief Systems**

Complementing the work on static knowledge representation, a distinct line of research has focused on the algorithmic implementation of Ranking Theory's *dynamic* aspects—the rules of belief revision and update. While Spohn's original formulations were conceptually clear, they were not always algorithmically transparent. The work in this area has sought to reformulate the dynamics in a computationally efficient manner and, in parallel, to provide a firm operational grounding for the numerical ranks that drive these dynamics. These two efforts, while distinct, are two sides of the same coin: making the quantitative nature of Ranking Theory both computationally practical and philosophically robust.

#### **6.1 Shenoy's Reformulation: From Global Revision to Local Combination**

Spohn's original update rules, particularly the general Spohn Conditionalization, are defined in terms of the initial epistemic state and the *final* epistemic state (e.g., the new rank assigned to the evidence proposition).<sup>33</sup> While philosophically sound, this is algorithmically awkward, as it requires knowing a feature of the outcome to compute the outcome. Prakash P. Shenoy's work provides a crucial reformulation that recasts belief revision in a more computationally friendly, compositional framework.

* **The Innovation: A Rule of Combination:** Shenoy's key insight was to reformulate Spohn's revision process not as a transformation based on a final state, but as a **rule of combination**. The agent's new, posterior belief state is the result of combining their prior belief state with an *incremental* belief state that represents the new evidence itself.<sup>33</sup>  
* **The Algorithm: Pointwise Addition:** This reformulation leads to a remarkably simple algorithm. When working with disbelief functions (which are functionally equivalent to negative ranking functions), the combination of a prior state and an evidential state is achieved by simple **pointwise addition** of their respective disbelief values for each possible world, followed by a normalization step to ensure the most plausible world has a rank of 0\.33 This is computationally far more direct than Spohn's original formulation.  
* **Enabling Local Computation:** The most significant consequence of this reformulation is that it unlocks the power of local computation. Shenoy demonstrated that his system of combination and marginalization (the process of deriving ranks for a subset of variables) satisfies the same set of abstract axioms (commutativity, associativity, distributivity) as probability theory and Dempster-Shafer theory.<sup>33</sup> These are precisely the axioms required to enable efficient  
  **belief propagation** algorithms on graphical models (like Bayesian networks). This means that for a complex system with many variables, one does not need to compute the full joint ranking function. Instead, updates can be performed through local message-passing between neighboring nodes in a graph, a massive algorithmic advantage that makes dynamic updating in large systems tractable.

#### **6.2 Hild & Spohn: Measuring Ranks via Iterated Contraction**

A persistent philosophical challenge to Ranking Theory has been the question of the numbers themselves: Where do the ranks come from? Are they psychologically real, or are they merely an arbitrary formal device?.<sup>12</sup> The collaborative work of Matthias Hild and Wolfgang Spohn provides a profound and deeply operational answer to this question, showing how ranks can be rigorously *measured* from an agent's observable behavior.

* **The Solution: An Algorithmic Measurement Procedure:** Hild and Spohn developed a conceptual algorithm for reconstructing an agent's underlying ranking function by observing only their qualitative belief changes, specifically their behavior under **iterated contraction** (the process of giving up one belief, then another, and so on).<sup>13</sup>  
* **The Conceptual Algorithm:** The procedure unfolds in several steps:  
  1. **Observe Contractions:** The input to the algorithm is the agent's iterated contraction policy—a function that specifies, for any sequence of propositions, what the agent's new belief state would be after contracting by them in that order.  
  2. **Infer Reason Relations:** The theory shows that an agent's "reason relations" (e.g., whether they take A as a reason for B) can be uniquely identified from specific patterns in their iterated contraction behavior. For example, how the belief in B changes after contracting first by A and then by C, versus first by C and then by A, reveals information about the relevance between A and B.<sup>34</sup>  
  3. **Compare Rank Differences:** From these inferred reason relations, it is possible to make comparative judgments about the *differences* between ranks. For instance, one can determine whether the difference in disbelief between A and B is greater than, less than, or equal to the difference between C and D.  
  4. **Reconstruct the Function:** Once this structure of differences is established, the mathematical **theory of difference measurement** (developed in measurement theory) can be applied. This theory proves that if the difference structure is sufficiently rich and well-behaved, there exists a numerical function—the negative ranking function κ—that represents it. Furthermore, this function is unique up to a positive multiplicative constant, meaning it is measured on a **ratio scale**.<sup>34</sup>  
* **Axiomatizing Contraction:** A crucial byproduct of this measurement procedure is a complete set of axioms (labeled IC1-IC6) that any rational iterated contraction policy must satisfy. These axioms, which include novel principles like "Restricted Commutativity" and "Path Independence," provide the first complete axiomatization of iterated contraction in the belief revision literature, going significantly beyond the well-known Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision.<sup>34</sup>

Together, the work of Shenoy and of Hild & Spohn provides a two-pronged defense of the quantitative nature of Ranking Theory. Hild and Spohn address the philosophical challenge, providing a rigorous operationalist justification for the existence and meaning of the numerical ranks by grounding them in observable, qualitative behavior. Shenoy addresses the engineering challenge, taking the numbers seriously and reformulating the theory's dynamics in a way that makes them computationally tractable through local, compositional algorithms. One provides the numbers with meaning, the other makes them work.

## **Part III: Advanced Applications, Distinctions, and Future Horizons**

Beyond its core applications in belief revision and non-monotonic reasoning, Ranking Theory's influence extends into more advanced philosophical domains, most notably the theory of causation. Its unique formal structure also necessitates a careful distinction from other, more widely known paradigms that use the term "ranking." Finally, a critical assessment of the theory's strengths and weaknesses points toward promising and challenging directions for future research, particularly at the intersection of formal epistemology and computational intelligence.

### **Section 7: Ranking-Theoretic Causal Inference**

One of Wolfgang Spohn's most ambitious and philosophically radical projects is the application of Ranking Theory to the analysis of **causation**. His account is not merely a new method for causal discovery but a fundamental rethinking of the metaphysical status of causality itself.

#### **7.1 Spohn's Projectivist Account of Causation**

The central thesis of Spohn's theory of causation is **projectivist**. It posits that "natural" or "alethic" modalities—features of the world like causation, dispositions, and laws of nature—are not fundamental, objective properties of reality. Instead, they are "objectifications" of our own *doxastic* modalities, that is, of the structure of our rational beliefs and reasons.<sup>13</sup>

* **Causation as an Objectified Reason Relation:** The heart of the account is the reduction of the causal relation to the rank-theoretic reason relation defined earlier. The statement "A is a direct cause of B" is analyzed as a claim that A is a robust and stable **reason** for B. More precisely, A is a direct cause of B, relative to a set of variables, if A is a reason for B (i.e., τ(B∣A)\>τ(B∣∼A)) conditional on every possible state of the other variables in the system that are not effects of A.<sup>13</sup> In essence, a causal structure is what you get when you take the stable, context-invariant reason-relations embedded in a rational agent's epistemic state (their ranking function) and project them onto the world as if they were objective features of it.

This approach represents a modern, formalized version of a deeply Humean philosophical tradition. David Hume argued that the "necessary connection" we perceive in causation is not a property of the objects themselves, but a product of the mind's "determination to pass from one object to its usual attendant." Spohn's theory provides a precise mathematical language for this idea: the "determination of the mind" is captured by the agent's ranking function, and the "necessary connection" is the stable, positive relevance relation it encodes.

#### **7.2 Comparison with Other Causal Models**

Spohn's epistemic, projectivist account stands in sharp contrast to the dominant paradigms of causal inference in AI, statistics, and computer science.

* **Structural Causal Models (SCMs):** The framework developed by Judea Pearl, which is now standard in AI, models causality using **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. In an SCM, nodes represent variables and directed edges represent direct causal mechanisms. The framework's power comes from the **do-calculus**, a set of formal rules for predicting the effects of external *interventions* on the system.<sup>38</sup> This is an objectivist and interventionist account: the causal graph represents real mechanisms in the world, and causality is defined by what happens when one actively manipulates those mechanisms.  
* **Potential Outcomes Framework:** The Neyman-Rubin causal model, prevalent in statistics and econometrics, defines causal effects by comparing **potential outcomes**. The causal effect of a treatment on an individual is the difference between the outcome they would have if they received the treatment and the outcome they would have if they received the control.<sup>41</sup> This is a counterfactual account, grounding causality in what *would have happened* under different conditions.

The fundamental difference is one of metaphysics. For Pearl and Rubin, causal relationships are objective features of the world to be discovered. For Spohn, the causal structure is not primitive; the primitive elements are non-modal facts and our epistemic state (the ranking function). Causal talk is a way of describing the stable, projectable features of our own rational inferential practices.<sup>13</sup>

#### **7.3 Algorithmic Implications**

While primarily a philosophical theory, Spohn's account has algorithmic implications for causal discovery. Standard algorithms, like the PC algorithm, work by identifying conditional independence relations in probabilistic data and using them to infer the structure of the causal DAG.<sup>43</sup> Spohn's theory suggests an alternative, epistemic path.

If one could fully map out a rational agent's epistemic state—for instance, by using the Hild-Spohn measurement procedure to reconstruct their ranking function from their belief revision behavior—one could then derive the causal graph that is implicitly encoded in that function's stable reason-relations.<sup>45</sup> This would be a form of causal discovery rooted not in statistical correlations from large datasets, but in the deep, rational structure of a single epistemic agent. While computationally formidable and reliant on strong assumptions about the agent's rationality, it presents a conceptually distinct alternative to mainstream data-driven methods.

### **Section 8: Clarifying the Landscape: Spohn's Theory vs. Other "Ranking" Paradigms**

The term "ranking" is used across many scientific and technical disciplines. To avoid significant confusion, it is crucial to explicitly distinguish Wolfgang Spohn's Ranking Theory from other prominent but unrelated paradigms that also employ this terminology. The shared vocabulary reflects a common underlying cognitive tool—the imposition of a graded order onto a complex space—but the domains, goals, and formalisms are fundamentally different.

#### **8.1 Learning-to-Rank (LTR) in Machine Learning**

Perhaps the most common source of confusion comes from the field of **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)**, a major subfield of machine learning and information retrieval.

* **Definition and Goal:** LTR refers to a suite of supervised machine learning techniques used to construct models that sort lists of items according to their relevance, preference, or importance.<sup>46</sup> Its primary application is in web search engines, where the goal is to rank a list of web pages in descending order of relevance to a user's query.  
* **Methodology:** LTR algorithms are trained on data consisting of queries and associated documents, where each document has a human-assigned relevance label (e.g., a score from 0 to 4). The algorithms are typically categorized into three families based on their loss function:  
  * **Pointwise:** Predicts an absolute relevance score for each individual document. The problem is treated as a regression task.<sup>46</sup>  
  * **Pairwise:** Takes pairs of documents as input and learns a classifier to predict which of the two is more relevant. The goal is to minimize the number of incorrectly ordered pairs.<sup>46</sup>  
  * **Listwise:** Takes an entire list of documents as input and attempts to directly optimize a list-based evaluation metric like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).<sup>47</sup>  
* **The Distinction:** The divergence from Spohn's theory is total. LTR is a data-driven, engineering discipline focused on optimizing predictive performance for a practical task. Spohn's Ranking Theory is a normative, philosophical theory of the structure of rational belief. LTR ranks *documents* based on *empirical relevance*; Spohn's theory ranks *possible worlds* based on *epistemic implausibility*. They share no formal or conceptual machinery beyond the generic use of an ordered scale.

#### **8.2 Ranking in Social Choice and Voting Theory**

Another major field that uses the language of ranking is **social choice theory**, which studies methods for aggregating individual preferences into a collective decision.

* **Definition and Goal:** In this context, "ranking" refers to an individual voter's preference ordering over a set of candidates or alternatives, submitted as a ballot. The central problem is to design a voting method or "social welfare function" that takes a collection of these individual rankings and produces a single, collective ranking that is, in some sense, fair.<sup>49</sup>  
* **Key Problems:** This field is famously home to results like **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem**, which proves that no voting system (for three or more candidates) can simultaneously satisfy a small set of desirable fairness criteria (like unanimity, non-dictatorship, and independence of irrelevant alternatives).<sup>42</sup>  
* **The Distinction:** Again, the subject matter is entirely different. Social choice theory is about the aggregation of subjective *preferences* from *multiple* agents to form a group decision. Spohn's Ranking Theory is about the representation of epistemic *beliefs* within a *single* rational agent. The former deals with social rationality and justice, the latter with individual epistemic rationality.

Clarifying these distinctions is not merely a pedantic exercise. It reveals the unique conceptual space that Spohn's theory occupies. While LTR and voting theory apply the general concept of ordering to the domains of empirical utility and social preference, respectively, Spohn's Ranking Theory applies it to the domain of epistemic plausibility. Understanding this—that the *object* being ranked (possible worlds) and the *criterion* for ranking (degrees of disbelief) are what define the theory—is essential to grasping its unique contribution to formal philosophy and AI.

### **Section 9: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Future Research Directions**

After a comprehensive examination of its philosophical foundations, formal structure, and algorithmic realizations, a balanced and critical assessment of Ranking Theory is possible. The theory possesses profound strengths that solve long-standing problems in epistemology, but it also faces significant challenges that point toward critical areas for future research. The path forward for computational Ranking Theory likely involves a hybridization of its normative principles with the data-driven power of modern machine learning.

#### **9.1 Summary of Strengths**

Ranking Theory's contributions to formal epistemology and AI are substantial and multifaceted.

* **Theoretical Unification:** Its greatest philosophical strength is its ability to elegantly unify the representation of graded belief (degrees of firmness) and belief simpliciter (all-or-nothing acceptance). This provides a deductively closed notion of belief that successfully resolves the Lottery Paradox without abandoning the concept of full belief.<sup>6</sup>  
* **Complete Dynamics:** It offers a complete, indefinitely iterable model of belief dynamics. By satisfying the principle of categorical matching, it provides a robust solution to the problem of iterated belief revision, a significant advance over the static AGM framework.<sup>12</sup>  
* **Rich Expressive Power:** The framework's formal structure is remarkably expressive. It provides a powerful and principled semantic foundation for non-monotonic reasoning, a sophisticated epistemic theory of causation, and formal accounts of concepts like reasons, dispositions, and ceteris paribus laws.<sup>22</sup>

#### **9.2 Acknowledged Weaknesses and Challenges**

Despite its theoretical virtues, Ranking Theory faces several practical and philosophical challenges that limit its direct application.

* **Computational Complexity:** As detailed previously, the theory's reliance on a state space of all possible worlds makes naive implementations computationally intractable.<sup>28</sup> While the development of c-representations and their implementation via SMT solvers has pushed the boundaries of what is feasible, scalability remains the single greatest barrier to widespread adoption. Research has shown that there is no guaranteed polynomial upper bound on the integer impacts required for c-representations, meaning some knowledge bases will inherently require exponentially large numbers to be represented, posing a hard limit on tractability.<sup>28</sup>  
* **Specification of Priors:** Ranking Theory provides the "laws of motion" for belief but says little about the starting point. The theory leaves the agent's initial, or *prior*, ranking function "largely unconstrained".<sup>9</sup> This is analogous to the problem of specifying prior probabilities in Bayesianism. Without a principled method for defining the initial ranks, the theory remains a model of  
  *change* rather than a complete model of belief formation.  
* **Cognitive Plausibility:** While the theory has been fruitfully applied as a formal model in cognitive psychology to explain reasoning phenomena, the strong claim that human beings actually represent and manipulate numerical ranks is a significant empirical question.<sup>8</sup> The cognitive effort required to perform complex ranking tasks is known to be high, which may cast doubt on its descriptive adequacy as a model of everyday human reasoning.<sup>51</sup>

#### **9.3 Future Research Directions**

The challenges facing Ranking Theory also define its most promising avenues for future research, particularly at the intersection of AI, logic, and machine learning.

* **Scalable and Approximate Algorithms:** The quest for greater scalability is paramount. Future work will likely focus on developing more sophisticated splitting and decomposition techniques for constraint networks, as well as robust **approximate inference** algorithms that trade a degree of logical soundness for significant gains in speed.<sup>52</sup>  
* **Learning Ranks from Data:** A major frontier is to bridge the gap between the theory's normative, knowledge-based approach and the data-driven paradigm of modern AI. A crucial research direction is the development of methods to **learn** ranking functions, or the impact parameters of c-representations, directly from empirical data. This would address the problem of prior specification and connect the theory to the vast datasets available today.<sup>53</sup>  
* **Deeper Integration with Other Formalisms:** The preliminary work on integrating Ranking Theory with formalisms like Answer Set Programming, probabilistic programming, and argumentation theory suggests a rich space for further exploration.<sup>16</sup> Creating hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of each framework could lead to more powerful and flexible reasoning engines.  
* **Robustness and Transfer Learning:** For Ranking Theory to be applicable in real-world systems, it must be robust to noisy, incomplete, or biased data. Research is needed on how to learn robust ranking functions and how to measure and control the sensitivity of inferences to perturbations in the knowledge base. Furthermore, adapting concepts from **transfer learning** to allow ranking structures learned in one domain to be applied to a new, related domain is a critical step toward practical utility.<sup>53</sup>

Ultimately, the future of computational Ranking Theory may not lie in its direct implementation as a standalone reasoning system, but in its use as a **normative blueprint** for building more intelligent and rational AI. The strengths and weaknesses of Ranking Theory and modern machine learning are strikingly complementary. Machine learning excels at learning complex functions from vast data but often produces "black box" models that lack interpretability and are based on mere correlation. Ranking Theory provides a transparent, interpretable, and normatively grounded model of reasoning but struggles with scalability and knowledge acquisition.

A promising synthesis would involve a **hybridization** of these approaches. For example, one could use a deep neural network not to predict an outcome directly, but to learn the optimal integer impacts for a c-representation from data. The neural network would handle the complex learning task, but its output would be a structured, interpretable ranking function that is guaranteed to obey the rational laws of belief change. Alternatively, the core principles of Ranking Theory, such as the formal definition of a "reason," could be incorporated as regularization terms or constraints in the loss functions of machine learning models, encouraging them to learn relationships that are not only predictive but also rational in a Spohnian sense. This suggests that the ultimate algorithmic realization of Ranking Theory may be its role in guiding the development of a new generation of AI systems that are not just powerful, but also demonstrably rational and explainable.
