    "\n",
    "Ranking Theory models an agent's degrees of surprise (or implausibility) via the negative ranking function κ. Formally, κ maps possible worlds to ℕ∪{∞} and lifts to propositions by the minimality rule: κ(A) = min{κ(w) : w ∈ A}. Intuitively, κ(A)=0 means A isn't disbelieved at all, while higher integers encode stronger disbelief; κ(W)=0 and the law of disjunction κ(A ∪ B) = min(κ(A), κ(B)) ensure coherence. In this library, a Ranking is a lazy generator of (value, rank) pairs that realizes κ operationally. Combinators like nrm_exc(normal, exceptional, penalty) construct tiny κ-structures by yielding the \"normal\" case at rank 0 and the \"exception\" at the given penalty; more complex programs compose these pieces while preserving minimal ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect disbelief to belief, we use the two-sided ranking τ defined by τ(A) = κ(¬A) − κ(A). Positive τ(A) indicates belief in A, negative indicates disbelief, and τ(A)=0 captures suspension of judgment. The law of negation guarantees at least one of κ(A), κ(¬A) is 0, making τ well-behaved. In code, Ranking.disbelief_rank computes κ(A) as the minimum rank over worlds satisfying A, and Ranking.belief_rank computes τ(A) from κ. Composition operators (e.g., rlet, rlet_star) combine independent pieces by adding ranks and normalizing, mirroring Shenoy's pointwise-addition view of updates. In the circuit below, \"worlds\" are assignments over N, O1, O2, and OUT; we can query κ/τ for propositions like OUT=True and see how they change under interventions.\n",

    "The `nrm_exc` (normal_exception) combinator directly realizes Spohn's negative ranking function κ for a binary choice between a \"normal\" and an \"exceptional\" outcome. In Spohn's nomenclature, κ assigns ranks to possible worlds: the normal case (e.g., No_Fault) gets κ=0, indicating no disbelief, while the exceptional case (e.g., Is_Faulted) gets κ equal to the penalty parameter, signifying a degree of surprise. This mirrors the law of disjunction, where the rank of the disjunction is the minimum of the individual ranks, ensuring the normal path is preferred unless overridden. Here, the penalty of 1 is a conventional default for simple binary uncertainties—it represents a single unit of disbelief, making the exceptional outcome \"just surprising\" but not impossibly so. In more complex scenarios, higher penalties (e.g., 2 or 3) can model stronger exceptions, reflecting graded implausibility as per Spohn's theory, where ranks accumulate through composition to capture cumulative disbelief in compound propositions. The rank 0 for the normal case is the default assigned by `nrm_exc` to represent the absence of surprise, analogous to Spohn's κ(W)=0 for the tautology, but here it's a direct implementation choice for the \"normal\" branch."

We'll model a circuit with fixed inputs (i1=False, i2=False, i3=True) and three potential faults: one in a NOT gate (N), and two in OR gates (O1, O2). Each fault is normally absent (No_Fault, meaning the gate works correctly), but can exceptionally be present (Is_Faulted, meaning the gate fails). The circuit computes (NOT i1) OR i2 OR i3, but with faults, the logic may short-circuit to Is_Faulted. We'll use rankings to explore all combinations of faults and their impact on the output.\n",

Analogous to `nrm_exc` directly realizing the negative ranking function κ for binary choices, `rlet` embodies the combination rule for independent disbelief functions, akin to Shenoy's pointwise addition for scalable belief updates. Its purpose is to model scenarios where multiple independent uncertainties (like faults) interact deterministically, allowing us to compute the joint ranking over all possible outcomes while preserving the graded plausibility from each component."

    "\n",
    "### Brief Definitions and Purposes\n",
    "- **Structural Ranking Model (SRM)**: An extension of causal modeling to Ranking Theory, where we represent a system as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of variables connected by local mechanisms. Each variable has a ranking over its possible values, and mechanisms define how parent variables influence child variables. SRM is designed to model causal relationships probabilistically using rankings, allowing us to compute joint rankings over the entire system and handle uncertainty in a graded, disbelief-based way.\n",
    "- **Interventions (\"do\")**: In causal inference, `do(X=x)` represents an external intervention that forces variable X to take value x, overriding its natural mechanism. In SRM, this is implemented as \"graph surgery,\" where we modify the mechanism of X to deterministically yield x at rank 0, ignoring its parents. This allows us to simulate counterfactual scenarios, such as \"what if we force a fault?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use SRM and \"do\" in This Example?\n",
    "SRM and interventions are used here to demonstrate causal reasoning in the Boolean circuit. Instead of just enumerating all fault combinations (as in the previous section), SRM models the circuit as a causal DAG: faults (N, O1, O2) influence intermediate signals (l1, l2), which affect the output (OUT). This captures the structural dependencies and allows us to apply interventions to simulate specific fault scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Example Shows\n",
    "The example models the same circuit as before but as an SRM, then applies `do(O2=False)` to intervene on the O2 fault (forcing it to be present). It compares the minimal disbelief ranks (κ) for OUT=True before and after the intervention:\n",
    "- **Before intervention**: The natural ranking reflects all possible fault combinations, with lower ranks for fewer faults.\n",
    "- **After intervention**: By forcing O2 to be faulted, we eliminate scenarios where O2 is not faulted, increasing disbelief in OUT=True (higher κ). This illustrates how interventions propagate disbelief through the causal graph, showing the causal effect of a fault on the output. It highlights SRM's ability to handle \"what if\" questions in uncertain systems, useful for diagnosis or planning."
