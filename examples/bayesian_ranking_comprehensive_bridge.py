Bayesian-Ranking Programming Bridge: Comprehensive Analysis
==========================================================

This file consolidates the essential code and explanations for bridging
Bayesian probability theory with ranked programming's ordinal disbelief ranks.

Key Components:
1. Bayesian-Ranking Bridge Table: Maps probabilities to disbelief ranks
2. Evidence Accumulation: Shows how evidence transforms uncertainty
3. Factor of 2 Justification: Why LR=2^evidence_units is meaningful
4. Systematic Approaches: Different methods for choosing disbelief ranks
