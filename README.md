# Ranked Programming

A Python library for ranked programming based on Wolfgang Spohn's Ranking Theory. Provides combinators and utilities for reasoning about uncertainty, surprise, and ranked choices in computation using a computationally simpler alternative to probabilistic methods.

**ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: Phase 4.1 Complete (Belief Propagation) âœ…**
- **153+ Tests** passing with zero technical debt
- **Complete Causal Reasoning** toolkit implemented
- **Efficient Belief Propagation** for large ranking networks
- **Full Theoretical Foundation** with Îº, Ï„, and conditional ranks
- **Comprehensive Documentation** and examples

This project started as a port of the Racket code from https://github.com/tjitze/ranked-programming.

## Important Note on Examples and Testing

**All example files in the `examples/regression` directory are ports of the original racket code and are used as regression tests.**

- If you add or modify an example/regression file (e.g., `examples/regression/hidden_markov.py`), you must ensure that its output remains consistent with the expected regression tests.
- Regression tests in `tests/` will run these examples and check their output. If you change the output format or logic, update the corresponding regression test.
- To add your own examples without affecting tests, use a different filename or directory, or disable regression checks for that file.

This ensures that the core examples remain stable and that changes to the library do not unintentionally break expected behavior.

## Synopsis

This library implements **Ranked Programming** based on Wolfgang Spohn's **Ranking Theory** - a philosophical framework for modeling uncertainty that distinguishes between "normal" and "exceptional" occurrences rather than using probabilities.

### Core Idea

While probabilistic programming is powerful, not all uncertainty is probabilistic. Some types of uncertainty are better described by distinguishing between what is "normal" and what is "exceptional". For instance, in fault diagnosis, we might know that a component normally works and only exceptionally fails, without knowing the specific probabilities of failure.

**Ranking Theory** provides an alternative: instead of probabilities, it uses integer "ranks" to measure uncertainty as degrees of surprise:

- **Rank 0:** Not surprising (a normal occurrence)
- **Rank 1:** Surprising (an exceptional occurrence)
- **Rank 2:** Even more surprising
- **Infinity (âˆž):** Impossible

### Ranked Programming

This library implements a programming model based on these principles. Expressions can have ranked choices, which normally return one value (with a rank of 0) but can exceptionally return another (with a rank of 1 or higher). The final rank of a result represents the number of exceptions that had to occur for that result to be produced.

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Belief Propagation**: Efficient inference in large ranking networks using Shenoy's algorithm
- **Causal Discovery**: Automatic discovery of causal relationships from ranking data
- **Theoretical Rigor**: Direct implementation of Spohn's mathematical framework
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles complex networks with message passing and caching

**Key Features:**
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Explicit implementation of Spohn's Ranking Theory with Îº (disbelief), Ï„ (belief), and conditional ranks
- **Causal Reasoning**: Complete causal inference toolkit using ranking-theoretic foundations
- **Belief Propagation**: Efficient inference in large ranking networks using Shenoy's algorithm
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Efficient handling of infinite or large search spaces
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations and modern Python support
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 153+ tests ensuring reliability
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work unchanged

**Applications:**
- Fault diagnosis in boolean circuits
- Spelling correction algorithms
- Ranking-based Hidden Markov Models
- Ranking networks for diagnostics
- **Causal discovery and inference**
- **Belief propagation in complex networks** (NEW)
- Any scenario where uncertainty is best described by "normal vs. exceptional" rather than precise probabilities

from ranked_programming.causal_reasoning import CausalReasoner
from ranked_programming.belief_propagation import BeliefPropagationNetwork

# 1. Basic ranking with normal/exceptional choices
ranking = Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc('healthy', 'faulty', 2))
print("Basic ranking:", list(ranking))

# 2. Theoretical functions
kappa = ranking.disbelief_rank(lambda x: x == 'healthy')  # Îº(healthy) = 0
tau = ranking.belief_rank(lambda x: x == 'healthy')       # Ï„(healthy) = 2
print(f"Îº(healthy) = {kappa}, Ï„(healthy) = {tau}")

# 3. Causal reasoning
reasoner = CausalReasoner()
# ... causal analysis code ...

# 4. Belief propagation
factors = {('A', 'B'): Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc(('A_ok', 'B_ok'), ('A_ok', 'B_bad'), 1))}
network = BeliefPropagationNetwork(factors)
marginals = network.propagate_beliefs()
print("Network marginals:", {k: list(v) for k, v in marginals.items()})
```

## Theoretical Foundation

This library explicitly implements **Wolfgang Spohn's Ranking Theory** with direct access to theoretical constructs:

```python
from ranked_programming import nrm_exc, Ranking

# Create a ranking with normal/exceptional choices
ranking = Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc('normal', 'exceptional', 1))

# Access theoretical functions directly
kappa_A = ranking.disbelief_rank(lambda x: x == 'normal')      # Îº(A) = 0
tau_A = ranking.belief_rank(lambda x: x == 'normal')           # Ï„(A) = 1
kappa_B_given_A = ranking.conditional_disbelief(
    lambda x: x == 'normal',    # Condition A
    lambda x: x == 'exceptional' # Consequent B
)  # Îº(B|A)
```

**Key Theoretical Methods:**
- `disbelief_rank(proposition)` - Computes Îº(A): degree of disbelief in proposition A
- `belief_rank(proposition)` - Computes Ï„(A): belief function Ï„(A) = Îº(âˆ¼A) - Îº(A)
- `conditional_disbelief(condition, consequent)` - Computes Îº(B|A): conditional disbelief

**Causal Reasoning Methods:**
- `is_direct_cause(cause, effect, background)` - Tests for direct causation using intervention
- `causal_effect_strength(cause, effect)` - Quantifies causal effect strength
- `conditional_causal_analysis(cause, effect, condition)` - Conditional causal analysis
- `pc_algorithm(variables, ranking)` - Constraint-based causal discovery (PC algorithm)
- `validate_causal_assumptions(graph, ranking, variables)` - Validates causal assumptions

**Belief Propagation Methods:**
- `BeliefPropagationNetwork` - Efficient inference in ranking networks
- `propagate_beliefs(evidence)` - Message passing with evidence integration
- `Shenoy's pointwise addition` - Mathematical foundation for combining rankings
- `marginalize(variable)` - Extract marginal distributions from networks

## Causal Reasoning

**NEW**: This library now includes a complete causal reasoning toolkit based on ranking theory:

```python
from ranked_programming.causal_reasoning import CausalReasoner
from ranked_programming import Ranking, nrm_exc

# Create observational data
ranking = Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc(
    ('A_true', 'B_true'),    # Normal case
    ('A_true', 'B_false'),   # Exceptional case
    1
))

# Test for causation
reasoner = CausalReasoner()
is_cause, strength = reasoner.is_direct_cause(
    lambda x: x[0] == 'A_true',   # Cause: A is true
    lambda x: x[1] == 'B_true',   # Effect: B is true
    [],                          # Background variables
    ranking
)

print(f"A causes B: {is_cause}, Strength: {strength}")

# Conditional causal analysis
results = reasoner.conditional_causal_analysis(
    lambda x: x[0] == 'A_true',   # Cause
    lambda x: x[1] == 'B_true',   # Effect
    lambda x: x[2] == 'C_true',   # Condition
    ranking
)

# Constraint-based causal discovery
causal_matrix = reasoner.pc_algorithm(
    [lambda x: x[0] == 'A_true', lambda x: x[1] == 'B_true'],
    ranking
)
```

**Causal Reasoning Features:**
- **Intervention Analysis**: Test causal relationships using interventions
- **Effect Strength Quantification**: Measure the strength of causal effects
- **Conditional Analysis**: Analyze causation under specific conditions
- **Causal Discovery**: Automatically discover causal structures from data
- **Structure Validation**: Validate causal assumptions and model correctness

## Belief Propagation

**NEW**: This library now includes efficient belief propagation for large ranking networks using Shenoy's pointwise addition algorithm:

```python
from ranked_programming.belief_propagation import BeliefPropagationNetwork
from ranked_programming import Ranking, nrm_exc

# Create a ranking network (e.g., A â†’ B â†’ C)
factors = {
    ('A',): Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc('A_healthy', 'A_faulty', 2)),
    ('A', 'B'): Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc(
        ('A_healthy', 'B_good'),
        ('A_healthy', 'B_bad'),
        1
    )),
    ('B', 'C'): Ranking(lambda: nrm_exc(
        ('B_good', 'C_working'),
        ('B_good', 'C_broken'),
        1
    ))
}

# Create belief propagation network
network = BeliefPropagationNetwork(factors)

# Compute marginals without evidence
marginals = network.propagate_beliefs()
print("Marginal for A:", list(marginals['A']))

# Add evidence and recompute
evidence = {'A': lambda x: x == 'A_healthy'}
marginals_with_evidence = network.propagate_beliefs(evidence)
print("Marginal for A with evidence:", list(marginals_with_evidence['A']))
```

**Belief Propagation Features:**
- **Shenoy's Algorithm**: Mathematically sound pointwise addition for ranking combination
- **Message Passing**: Efficient inference in large networks through message passing
- **Evidence Integration**: Proper conditioning using observe_e combinator
- **Marginal Computation**: Extract marginal distributions from complex networks
- **Scalability**: Handles large networks with caching and lazy evaluation

  Marketing blurb:
  Wolfgang Spohn presents the first full account of the dynamic laws of belief, by means of ranking theory. This book is his presentation of ranking theory and its ramifications. He motivates and introduces the basic notion of a ranking function, which recognises degrees of belief and at the same time accounts for belief simpliciter. He provides a measurement theory for ranking functions, accounts for auto-epistemology in ranking-theoretic terms, and explicates the basic notion of a (deductive or non-deductive) reason. The rich philosophical applications of Spohn's theory include: a new account of lawlikeness, an account of ceteris paribus laws, a new perspective on dispositions, a rich and detailed theory of deterministic causation, an understanding of natural modalities as an objectification of epistemic modalities, an account of the experiential basis of belief--and thus a restructuring of the debate on foundationalism and coherentism (and externalism and contextualism)--and, finally, a revival of fundamental a priori principles of reason fathoming the basics of empiricism and the relation between reason and truth, and concluding in a proof of a weak principle of causality. All this is accompanied by thorough comparative discussions, on a general level as well as within each topic, and in particular with respect to probability theory.

## Deduplication Policy

All core combinators in this library always deduplicate values by their hashable identity, keeping only the first occurrence (with the minimal rank) for each hashable value. Unhashable values (such as lists or dicts) are always yielded, even if repeated. This deduplication is always enabled and is not user-configurable. Deduplication is performed lazily as values are generated, so infinite/lazy structures are supported.

For more details, see the Python reference documentation (`docs/python_reference.md`) and the Sphinx API docs.
